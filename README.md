## 📝 Objective
The objective of this project was to design a responsive "Tribute Page" dedicated to a person of admiration. The technical goal was to master the fundamentals of **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for layout/typography, ensuring the page effectively conveys information through a clean, respectful, and aesthetically pleasing design.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Used for semantic structuring of the page (headers, main sections, footers, image containers).
* **CSS3:** Used for styling the timeline, formatting text, managing spacing (margin/padding), and adding background colors/images.
* **Google Fonts:** To enhance the typography and readability of the content.
* **GitHub:** For version control and hosting.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1.  **Subject Selection:** Chose **Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam** as the subject and gathered biographical data, achievements, and high-quality images.
2.  **Layout Design:** Planned the structure using a main header for the title/image, a central section for the timeline/biography, and a footer for citations.
3.  **HTML Structure:** Wrote the code to organize content into logical sections (`div`, `header`, `section`, `ul` for lists).
4.  **Styling & Theming:** Applied CSS to create a cohesive color scheme that reflects the personality of the subject. Used Flexbox/Grid to align elements properly.
5.  **Responsiveness:** Ensured images resize correctly and text remains readable on smaller screens.
6.  **Deployment:** Hosted the static page using GitHub Pages.

## 🌟 Outcome
The final result is a polished, informative webpage that serves as a digital biography. It demonstrates a strong grasp of static web page design, image handling, and typographical hierarchy.
